❖ Aim: To develop a model that predicts the best possible leads for an office items supplier’s sales team.
Techstack: Python 3.7, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn.
❖ Implemented a logistic regression model which predicted that a customer would purchase a product during
future campaign sales at 83% probability accuracy. Developed a multivariate linear regression model that
calculated the expected sales forecast of future campaign sales from customer purchases identified in the first
model at 100% accuracy.
